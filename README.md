### helpful commands for myself
Using [Jekyll with Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/) in order to save plugins and stuff. This uses the Gemfile.


`bundle exec jekyll serve` in the root directory to start a dev server of the blog contents

`bundle exec jekyll build` to build the whole site as static files, and put into `_site`.
