title: The Horrible State of Reviews in the Windows Phone App Store
---

I really want to like Windows Phone, I really do. I think it has a slick interface, and I really like the hardware of the Nokia Lumia line. But Microsoft is going to have major problems if it doesn't clean up its Windows Phone App Store, and soon. 

I ran across the [Skype](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/skype/c3f8e570-68b3-4d6a-bdbb-c0a3f4360a51) page. Take a look at the review section:

What is this garbage? How am I supposed to trust an app if I can't even get reviews on it? Why should I trust an app store that doesn't monitor its review sections, or even filter spam? Finally, why the hell does Microsoft not care that Skype, its main communications app, has such spammy reviews? 

For comparison, take a look at the Skype for iPhone reviews:

Now these are some useful reviews. Useful for me, as a consumer, but also useful for Microsoft as feedback on their app. Both sides benefit from spam-less app reviews. 

I was going to make my next phone (and first smartphone) a Windows Phone, but after seeing that Microsoft can't get something as basic as spam filtering implemented, I'm suspicious that other parts of Windows Phone are still unfinished as well. Maybe in a few years.
