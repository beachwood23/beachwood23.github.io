title: Give Me My Search Results
---

How much space do search engines devote to advertising space? Unless we're shopping, the results we're looking for in a search query are usually tucked beneath text ads. 

In the past few years, web browsers have embraced a more minimal frame, trying to get out of our way. This movement was sort of spurred by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome">Chrome</a> browser in 2008. Google recognized that users want to use the <b>web</b>, not their web browser. I believe the same idea applies to search engines. When searching, I'm not using Google for the sake of it, I'm trying to find a piece of information. So, how well do search engines "get out of your way" and give you what you want?

I queried several search engines for "flamingo." Here's the results: 

<table border="1" align="center" style="width:300px;">
	<tr>
		<th>Search Engine</th>
		<th>Distance to results (in pixels)</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Google</td>
		<td>280</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Bing</td>
		<td>300</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Yahoo!</td>
		<td>590</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>DuckDuckGo</td>
		<td>78</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Yandex</td>
		<td>88</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Dogpile</td>
		<td>490</td>
	</tr>
</table>

I've included the actual images and searches at the bottom of this post. Meanwhile, I'm astounded at how much space a search on Yahoo! takes. I can understand that you need your users to see ads, but almost the entire visible webpage is ads. The real search results don't begin until almost 600 pixels down. Ridiculous. On the other hand, DuckDuckGo's real results managed to hop over the ads because of its instant-answer box, getting you to content in less than 80 pixels. Fabulous. The one ad DuckDuckGo displayed was directly beneath the instant-answer box. Also coming in very svelte was Yandex, the Russian search engine, at about 90 pixels. It showed me no ads whatsoever, and even returned the Wikipedia page for Flamingo's as the first result, which I like more than the Flamingo Hotel result the other engines favored. 

As an aside, I don't like Google's implementation of its context suggestions, where they are located on the right side of the page. It takes effort to see those, since they're not in the normal eye flow of scanning down the search results. I didn't even notice the box until I was editing the image. DuckDuckGo's instant-answer box is a much better solution I think, although I understand Google is a bit more committed to advertising revenue.
