title: Songza, I Love You
---

Found a great new online radio app. [Songza](http://songza.com) has no ads, and tons of different stations and presets. 

You can find stations the normal way, through "genres" and "similar artists," but the feature I'm really impressed by is the ability to browse by activity. Songza gives you an absurd variety of curated playlists, for really any activity you can think of. Here's just a short selection:

* Barbecuing
* Coding
* Formal Dinner Party
* Grinding at a Nightclub
* Lying on a Beach
* Skateboarding
* Working Out: Weight training

I have no idea how they came up with some of these ideas, but Songza seems to have a radio station for anything you might be doing. I've been using it myself the past week for coding, homework, and housework (all have their own presets).
