title: Learning Basic Photoshop Retouching
---

Having just graduated from Lehigh University, I now have loads of photos to sort through and edit. I've been teaching myself basic things in Photoshop this weekend, and I think its starting to show. 

One of my favorite pictures from the last week was the one below of me and my Nan (grandma).

This is a great picture, but it can be better. First, both of our teeth could be whitened a little bit. Second, we both have several blemishes -- I have a pimple on my neck, and red spots on my forehead, my Nan some lines under her eyes. This is the age of computers, so that kind of imperfection is unacceptable. I want us both to look like models. After an hour or so of work, here's the result:

I fixed our teeth and blemishes, but also changed the overall tone of the photo. Increasing the temperature of photos tends to make them feel warmer, more friendly, so I did that. Then, I added a faint dimming effect around the borders of the photo, to really make us pop out. 

Obviously I'm not anywhere close to using Photoshop fully, but I was impressed with how easy it was to get started. The "Spot Healing Brush Tool" was especially powerful and easy (once I discovered it!).
