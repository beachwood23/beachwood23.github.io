title: Search is Broken in the Desktop Kindle App
---

This past weekend, I was working on a research paper for my history class. I purchased the Kindle version of the 700-page book - I have a Kindle and the e-book version was $10 cheaper. 

One advantage of e-books over hardcopy books is the ability to search for specific words and terms throughout the text. This comes handy when writing papers on a specific topic, like I was. Searching for text on the Kindle device itself is slow and clunky, so its preferable to use the desktop app. 

However, the search functionality in the desktop app is strictly limited to 100 search results, as shown in the image below:

On my Kindle device, searching for the same term returns 170 results:

<img alt="Kindle device search results" style="float: center" src="/images/kindle_device_search.jpg" height="400" width="250"/>

This is kind of annoying. More annoying was talking to Amazon customer support about the issue. While very polite, the chat representative's only thought was "Since the kindle device has a smaller screen, it displays different results than your mac." I don't really understand that logic, but oh well.
