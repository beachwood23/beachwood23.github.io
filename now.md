## What am I doing now?
Borrowing the idea of the "now" page from [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now2).

### December 1, 2024

I am living in Burlington, Vermont. We moved over the summer. 

My recovery from last winter's [herniated disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation) has had its ups and downs. For a while, I was getting better, and then I played golf again and it went downhill. I've slowly been building back up to running and other fitness like soccer. With the stop-start nature of my fitness, I keep pulling muscles and odd things. Still recording workout runs on my [Strava account](https://strava.app.link/YHUk3J60mKb).

I'm excited for the ski season. Hoping to do more backcountry skiing this year, in addition to downhill.

I started a new job, as well. I'm now working as a performance engineer (once again), this time at [One](www.one.app). For some time, I've been interested in how modern finance can work better for us. And, it's a company with a lot of growth potential. I've been working a lot, and it's a bit of a change from Nuix, but I am learning a lot.

### June 12, 2024

I am living in Winooski, Vermont.

Trying to recover from a [herniated disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation), so slowly building back up to running, golf, and soccer.

Last year, I switched positions at [Nuix](https://www.nuix.com). I was a performance engineer for 7 years, but now I am a software engineer. The way I think of it: I know how to break software, now I want to learn how to build it so others can't break it.

With my back, I am trying to do "micro-runs" through out the day. Small jogs of around one mile, to break up the day, get my fitness levels back up, and allows for my back to rest in between workouts. I'm recording my workouts in [Strava](https://strava.app.link/YHUk3J60mKb) to track my progress.
