## What am I doing now?
June 12, 2024

I am living in Winooski, Vermont.

Trying to recover from a [herniated disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation), so slowly building back up to running, golf, and soccer.

I recently switched positions at [Nuix](https://www.nuix.com). I was a performance engineer for 7 years, but now I am a software engineer. The way I think of it: I know how to break software, now I want to learn how to build it so others can't break it.

With my back, I am trying to do "micro-runs" through out the day. Small jogs of around one mile, to break up the day, get my fitness levels back up, and allows for my back to rest in between workouts. I'm recording my workouts in [Strava](https://strava.app.link/YHUk3J60mKb) to track my progress.
